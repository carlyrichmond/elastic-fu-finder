#### IR Datasets

For Elastic-fu Finder, we used a subset of the [top 10 million websites](https://www.domcop.com/top-10-million-websites) as calculated via the [Open PageRank initiative](https://www.domcop.com/openpagerank/what-is-openpagerank). Open PageRank uses a couple of sources for it's website dataset, including [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/).
